| 1 | groupedBy | Indicates which attribute the   data was grouped by when calculating the mean of each variable.     Possible values:      "subject" which indicates the data was grouped by unique   "subject" values. Subject is identifier of the subject who carried   out the experiment. Derived by joining the activity data (from x_test.txt for   test and x_train.txt for training) to the subject data (subject_test.txt for   test data subject_train.txt for training data).     "activityDescription" which indicates the data was goruped by   unique "activityDescription" values. ActivityDescription is a   description of the activity the subject was performing when the measures were   captured. Derived by:     1. Joining the data from  the   training labels file (y_train.txt for training, y_test.txt for  test) to the activity_labels.txt file where   the first column in activity_labels.txt matches the value in each of the   y_*.txt files     2. Removing all columns other than activity description     3. Column binding the output of step 2 to the activity data (from   x_test.txt for test and x_train.txt for training)       |
| 2 | groupedByValue | Indicates the value of the   groupedBy attribute.     If groupedBy is subject then the range is 1 to 30     If groupedBy is activity then possible values include:  LAYING SITTING STANDING WALKING   WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS WALKING_UPSTAIRS |
